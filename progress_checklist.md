## C. Enhancements

### Tracking and docs
- [x] `progress.md` updated to reflect actual build state
- [x] Progress checklist split into User App / Admin App / Enhancements
- [ ] Keep status files in sync with repo as development continues
- [x] Jest test runner installed in `apps/user` (2026-07-17) — `lib/__tests__/tng-matcher.test.ts` existed since before this session but no test runner was ever installed for it, so `pnpm tsc --noEmit` failed with 63 pre-existing `TS2582`/`TS2304` errors (`describe`/`it`/`expect` unrecognized) unrelated to any current feature work. Added `jest.config.js` (via Next.js's `next/jest` preset) + `jest`/`@types/jest`/`jest-environment-node` devDependencies + `pnpm test` script.
- [x] **Real bug found + fixed by running tests for the first time (2026-07-17):** `lib/tng-matcher.ts`'s sector-compatibility gate only recognised TOLL↔TOLL and PARKING↔PARKING, so TAXI/GRAB/TRAIN/BUS claim items paid via TNG (which `/api/claims/[id]/tng-suggestions/route.ts` explicitly fetches for this purpose) could never auto-match their RETAIL-sector TNG transaction — a silently broken code path since it was written, invisible because the tests that would have caught it never ran. Fixed by wiring in the already-written-but-unused `isCompatiblePair()` helper. Added a regression test proving TAXI↔RETAIL matching now works, and corrected the one pre-existing test whose assertion depended on the bug. See `lib/tng-matcher.ts` inline comment for detail.

### Product / platform next steps
- [ ] Complete admin operational workflows
- [ ] Review dependency alignment between user app and admin app
- [ ] Improve export template / format management
- [ ] Implement original statement attachment + claim highlighting workflow
- [ ] Polish export history / retry / download UX

## D. AI Capture Upgrade (planning stage — 2026-07-17)

Full detail: `docs/02-product-specs/02_AI_ASSISTANT_AUTOMATION_SPEC.md` (spec) and `docs/03-sprint-plans/ai-capture/01_SPRINT_PLAN_AI_CAPTURE.md` (sprint-by-sprint plan). Nothing below is built yet — additive upgrade, does not modify existing claim/export/lock behavior.

- [x] S0 — Compliance & provider prep (Gemini key, PDPA sign-off) — done 2026-07-17
- [x] S1 — Receipt auto-fill (web, shared key) — done 2026-07-17. Corrected same day: first pass wired the wrong (unused) TransportModal file; re-wired into the actual live modals in claims/[id]/page.tsx (Meal, Lodging, Toll, Parking, Transport, Misc). Per Diem has no receipt field, N/A.
- [x] S2 — Receipt auto-fill (mobile + tier gate) — auto-fill wiring + tier gate shipped early as part of S1; offline-deferred retry gap closed 2026-07-18 (`useDeferredAiExtraction`, applies to both receipt and odometer scanning). QA still not run — see sprint plan S2 for the testing checklist.
- [x] S3 — Odometer AI reading — built 2026-07-18, tested on-device 2026-07-19 (mobile-v2 only: `/api/ai/extract-odometer` route + BYOK direct path + `TripsScreen.tsx` origin/destination wiring, `ai_odometer_scan` gate). Four bugs found and fixed during testing: (1) evidence photo preview showed the raw `file://` URI as text instead of an actual thumbnail; (2) the "Save Car/Motorcycle Trip" button silently stayed disabled with no explanation whenever `destinationReading` wasn't greater than `originReading` (the real gate all along — `odoValid` requires a positive distance, not the optional location text fields) — added an inline warning showing both readings; (3) tapping the thumbnail did nothing — added a shared `EvidenceThumbnail` component (used in both the create flow and trip detail) with a full-screen tap-to-view lightbox; (4) evidence photos ARE persisted correctly (`startEvidenceUri`/`endEvidenceUri` round-trip through `tripRepository.ts` fine) but the trip detail/edit modal never displayed them at all — added an "Odometer Evidence" section there showing origin/destination thumbnails. Web page wiring deliberately skipped — `apps/user` pages aren't the real product, same call as S1.
- [x] S4 — Voice claim entry (cloud) — built 2026-07-18, **confirmed working on-device 2026-07-19** (mobile-v2 only: standalone voice-entry button, `/api/ai/parse-voice-claim`, `ai_voice_claim` gate, reusable `VoiceRecorderModal`). **Requires a custom dev client, not Expo Go** — Expo Go's per-experience storage sandbox blocks JS from reading the file `expo-audio` writes natively (confirmed via `expo-file-system`'s own changelog: "In Expo Go, `Paths.cache`/`Paths.document` point to experience-isolated directories" — `expo-audio` writes outside that scope). Built via `npx expo run:android` (free, local build, no EAS/paid tier — Windows note: long project path triggers Gradle's short-path workaround at `C:\exp\...`, which breaks `expo run:android`'s auto-install/Metro-start step; workaround is `adb install` the built APK manually, then `npx expo start --dev-client` separately, then `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` if Metro won't connect over USB). Also fixed on-device: (1) recorder file-finalization race + directory-scan fallback for a confirmed upstream expo-audio zero-byte-URI bug (expo/expo#39646), (2) type-confirm sheet z-index (now a native Modal, was hidden behind the submit button), (3) "AudioRecorder already prepared" crash when cancelling mid-recording (recorder now stopped on close). Receipt AI scan also confirmed working on this dev-client build.
- [x] S5 — Bring-your-own-key (BYOK) — built 2026-07-18 for receipt scanning (mobile-v2 only; odometer/voice BYOK deferred until S3/S4 exist). Client-side only — key stored via expo-secure-store/localStorage, calls Gemini directly from device, never touches myexpensio's servers. Settings → AI Receipt Scanning. Not yet manually tested by Eff — see S5 testing checklist in the sprint plan.
- [ ] S6 — On-device fast path (Android)
- [ ] S7 — Audit trail, compliance polish, `scan_service` decision

## Current Development Position
- **User App:** stable enough for structured user testing
- **Admin App:** protected and scaffolded, but still partially placeholder
- **Next recommended build target:** Admin App completion or export enhancement batch
